# Open3G Map
A street map that displays crowd sourced mobile network data such as network type and signal strength associated with a GPS location. Additionally, approximate cell and lac coverage is calculated by applying a convex hull algorithm on the gathered data points.
Current data sources are:
 * [Sensorium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.univie.sensorium), an Android App which this map was developed for.
 * [RTR] (https://www.netztest.at/de/Opendata.html) Data (currently parsed manually).
